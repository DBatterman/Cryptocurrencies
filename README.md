# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this project is to assist a fictional investment bank with cryptocurrencies. We create a clustering algorithm to group which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market, and then find the best ways to group them. After that, we use data visualization tools to display our results to the bank.
